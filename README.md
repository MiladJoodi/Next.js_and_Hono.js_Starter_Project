# **Next.js & Hono.js Starter Project 🚀📡**

Welcome to the **Next.js & Hono.js Starter Project**! This is a simple and beginner-friendly setup for integrating **Next.js** with **Hono.js**. It's perfect for those who are just getting started with these technologies. This project demonstrates how to quickly set up and use both in a single application.

### **🔧 How to Use**

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MiladJoodi/Next.js_and_Hono.js_Starter_Project.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Navigate into the project folder and install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd Next.js_and_Hono.js_Starter_Project
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**  
   Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Your app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### **🚀 Project Setup Explanation**

This project is a very basic starter for integrating **Next.js** (a React framework) and **Hono.js** (a lightweight, high-performance web framework). It provides two simple routes: 

- A **GET** route that returns plain text from **Hono.js**.
- A **GET** route that returns JSON data from **Hono.js**.

It’s a great first step for experimenting with **Hono.js** and **Next.js** together.

### **📝 Setup Steps**

1. **Install Next.js**  
   The core of this project is built on **Next.js**. If you're unfamiliar with it, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and much more.

2. **Integrate Hono.js**  
   **Hono.js** is used to create the API routes. We’ve used it in this starter project to set up a fast, minimal API alongside the Next.js app.

3. **Folder Structure**  
   The project uses Next.js **App Router** structure, and the API routes are placed in:
   ```
   /app/api/hono/route.ts
   ```

4. **Custom API Routes**  
   The **GET** requests are handled by **Hono.js**, with routing configured in `route.ts`.

### **📡 Routes**

- **Plain text route**:  
   Access this route at `http://localhost:3000/`. It will return:
   ```
   Hello from Hono.js!
   ```

- **JSON route**:  
   Access this route at `http://localhost:3000/`. It will return:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "This is a JSON response from Hono.js"
   }
   ```

---

### **🛠️ Requirements**

- **Node.js** (version 16.8 or higher)
- **npm** (or **yarn**)

---

### **⚠️ Notes**

- This is a simple starter project, ideal for learning and exploring **Next.js** and **Hono.js** together.
- The project can be easily expanded for more complex use cases by adding additional routes or deploying it to serverless platforms like **Cloudflare Workers**.
